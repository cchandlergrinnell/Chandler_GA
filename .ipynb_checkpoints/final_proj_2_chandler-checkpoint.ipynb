    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lack of transparancy in the cryptocurrency markets, and as a result currencies are often slow to react. By understanding what drives the returns of currencies, how like ones should behave, and how similar events have played out, we can predict the price movements. "

    "First limit the selection by market cap to limit sample size and remove new currencies and get stable data. Do this by using the coinmarketcap API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next using the cryptocompare API, we create a database by calling the api on various coins. We then collect the trailing 2000 hours of returns and add it to the current list. Currently, I have hourly data back to July for roughly 300 coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use data from cryptocompare API such as description, algorithm, # of coins and market cap to group and figure out what factors make coins successful. \n",

    "Have worked with twitter sentiment model in the past. I may do some of that if there is time, but am not sure how to include it in a time series as that is also a time series. "
